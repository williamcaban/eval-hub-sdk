"""EvalHub SDK - Python SDK for interacting with EvalHub.

This SDK provides three main components:

1. **Common Models**: Core data models for EvalHub (always available)
   - Benchmarks, evaluations, jobs, providers, and collections
   - Request/response schemas and status enums

2. **Python Client**: High-level API for interacting with EvalHub REST endpoints
   - Synchronous and asynchronous clients
   - Evaluation job submission and management
   - Provider and benchmark discovery

3. **Framework Adapters**: SDK for building custom evaluation framework adapters
   - Standardised interfaces for "Bring Your Own Framework" (BYOF) approach
   - Integration patterns for custom evaluation frameworks

Installation extras:
  - core: Basic functionality for HTTP client operations
  - adapter: Components for building custom evaluation framework adapters
  - client: High-level Python API for end users
  - cli: Command-line interface
  - all: All functionality except examples
